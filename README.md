reading materials:

- Mining Framework Usage Graphs from App Corpora, SANER 2018 - http://www.sergiomover.eu/paper/saner18.pdf
This is a work we did last year and focuses on mining APIs patterns.

- code2vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code, POPL 2019 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09473
This is a reference on learning “program models” using neural networks. The model can be used for searching similar code and code completion.

- Learning to represent programs with graphs - ICRL 2018 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00740
Another model to capture programs.
