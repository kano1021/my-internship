Mining Framework Usage Graphs from App Corpora

Problem: "mining graph-based usage patterns for large, object-oriented frameworks like Android"
existing method: Groums Mining
challenge: high cost in solving a subgraph isomorphism problem
solution/contribution: BIGGROUM
  1.combine frequent itemset mining with groum mining (mainly definitions and theories)
  2.use a SAT-based encoding
    challenge: for big graph: checking the satisfiability of the embedding encoding is not practical
    solutions: use optimization to reduce the size
  3.organize the groums of each sub-corpus defined by a itemset cluster into lattice-ordered bins of groums (logroums)

LEARNING TO REPRESENT PROGRAMS WITH GRAPHS
Challenge: Current work miss out on the opportunity to capitalize on the rich and well-defined semantics of source code
Contribution: "take a step to alleviate this by including two additional signal sources in source code: data flow and 
              type hierarchies"

Learning Distributed Representations of Code



Problem: the article is long and contains lots of things that I don't contact before. 
         When reading it, I have to keep reread the previous sentenses, but it's still 
         difficult for me to understand and remember things.
