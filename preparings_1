Mining Framework Usage Graphs from App Corpora

Problem: "mining graph-based usage patterns for large, object-oriented frameworks like Android"
existing method: Groums Mining
challenge: high cost in solving a subgraph isomorphism problem
solution/contribution: BIGGROUM
  1.combine frequent itemset mining with groum mining
  2.use a SAT-based encoding
  3.organize the groums of each sub-corpus defined by a itemset cluster into lattice-ordered bins of groums (logroums)
